SUBTASK 3-2: Verify All Database Jobs Pass - BLOCKED
=================================================================
Date: 2026-01-14
Status: BLOCKED - Awaiting PR Creation

BLOCKER DETAILS:
Cannot verify database jobs because CI workflow has not been triggered.

ROOT CAUSE:
The GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yaml) is configured to run only on:
  - push events to 'main' branch
  - pull_request events

The feature branch 'auto-claude/005-run-unit-tests-in-parallel' has been pushed
with all code changes, but NO pull request has been created yet.

VERIFICATION STATUS:
✅ Code changes pushed to remote branch
✅ Branch exists: origin/auto-claude/005-run-unit-tests-in-parallel
✅ Commits include all --parallel flags for Unit and Integration tests
✅ YAML syntax validated
❌ Pull request NOT created (needs GitHub authentication)
❌ CI workflow NOT triggered (needs pull request)
❌ Database jobs NOT running (needs CI workflow)

ACTION NEEDED TO UNBLOCK:
Create a pull request to trigger the CI workflow:

URL: https://github.com/pelican-dev/panel/compare/main...auto-claude/005-run-unit-tests-in-parallel

Suggested PR Configuration:
- Title: "feat: Enable parallel test execution in CI pipeline"
- Type: Draft PR (for validation)
- Base: main
- Head: auto-claude/005-run-unit-tests-in-parallel

PR Body: See /tmp/pr_body.txt

VERIFICATION STEPS AFTER PR CREATION:
Once PR is created and CI is triggered, verify:

1. SQLite job passes across PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 (4 jobs)
2. MySQL job passes across PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 (4 jobs)
3. MariaDB jobs pass:
   - MariaDB 10.6 × PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 (4 jobs)
   - MariaDB 10.11 × PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 (4 jobs)
   - MariaDB 11.4 × PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 (4 jobs)
   Total: 12 MariaDB jobs
4. PostgreSQL job passes across PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 (4 jobs)
5. Check logs show parallel process execution
6. No database locking errors in logs (especially SQLite)
7. No resource exhaustion or OOM errors in logs

TOTAL EXPECTED JOBS: 24 (SQLite: 4, MySQL: 4, MariaDB: 12, PostgreSQL: 4)

IMPACT:
- Subtask 3-2 cannot be completed without PR creation
- Subtask 3-3 (performance comparison) also depends on CI execution
- Phase 3 (CI Validation) is blocked
- Phase 4 (Documentation) depends on Phase 3 completion
